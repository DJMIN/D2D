<h1 class="header">DBUtils 1.0 Release Notes</h1>

<p>DBUtils 1.0 was released on November 29, 2008.</p>

<p>This is the sixth public release of DBUtils.</p>

<h2>Changes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a <code>failures</code> parameter for configuring the exception classes for
which the failover mechanisms is applied (as suggested by Matthew Harriger).</li>
<li>Added a <code>closeable</code> parameter for configuring whether connections
can be closed (otherwise closing connections will be silently ignored).</li>
<li>It is now possible to override defaults via the <code>creator.dbapi</code>
and <code>creator.threadsafety</code> attributes.</li>
<li>Added alias method <code>dedicated_connection</code> for
<code>connection(shareable=False)</code>.</li>
<li>Added a <code>version</code> attribute to all exported classes.</li>
<li>Where <code>0</code> has the meaning "unlimited", parameters can now be also
set to <code>None</code> instead.</li>
<li>It turned out that <code>threading.local</code> does not work properly with
<code>mod_wsgi</code>, so we use the Python implementation for thread-local data
even when a faster <code>threading.local</code> implementation is available.
A new parameter <code>threadlocal</code> allows you to pass an arbitrary class
such as <code>threading.local</code> if you know it works in your environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bugfixes and Improvements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, when instance initialization failed or referenced objects
were already destroyed, finalizers could throw exceptions or create infinite
recursion (problem reported by Gregory Pinero and Jehiah Czebotar).</li>
<li>DBUtils now tries harder to find the underlying DB-API 2 module if only a
connection creator function is specified. This had not worked before with the
MySQLdb module (problem reported by Gregory Pinero).</li>
</ul>
